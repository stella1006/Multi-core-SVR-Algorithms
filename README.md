# Summer Research 2017
### Multi-core Implementation of Stochastic Variance Reduced Algorithms
#### Advisor: James Cheng (Assistant Professor, CSE, CUHK)
* Study algorithms of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Stochastic variance reduced gradient (SVRG) and other new improvements on them like the Lazy Update.
* Multi-core implementation on algorithms of Logistic Regression and SVM and apply them on the experiment of binary classification.
